### Byte Pair Encoding Implementation

This project implements and evaluates the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm on NLTK's Gutenberg Corpus. The primary focus is to develop the BPE algorithm, train it on selected texts, and then evaluate its performance using various metrics.

### Getting Started

To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)


#### Installing

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone ```zihanwang00/nlp```
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Assn1
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (assn1_1.ipynb)

### Project Structure

`assn1_1.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and evaluation of the BPE algorithm.
`assn1_1.pdf`: The project report detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions.

### Implementation Details

The project is divided into the following parts:

1. Implement BPE Algorithm
2. Train on NLTK Dataset
3. Test on NLTK Dataset
4. Create Reference Tokenization
5. Compare with Standard Tokenization
6. Visualizations
Each part is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations and comments.
